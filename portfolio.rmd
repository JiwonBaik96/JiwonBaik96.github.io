### 1.1. 3d Acoustic Propagation Modeling


- [presentation](data/Sound_Propagation_Model.pdf)
- [sourcecode](data/SoundPropagation.html) : The sourcecode relies on arcpy module. The ipynb file should be operated within ArcGIS Pro, as an inserted Notebook.

<b>On the importance of sentence length</b></p>

This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together bocome monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.<br><br>
    Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasent rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals -- sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
