### 1.1. 3d Acoustic Propagation Modeling

#### [Ongoing]

<b>3d Acoustic Propagation Modeling</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>

* This project is to model the sound propagation from the outdoor emergency sirens on the UCSB campus.
* The 3D building representation and detailed terrain elevation with vegetation height included were obtained from LIDAR pointcloud data.
* Each building has it's shape refined by using the <b>SketchUp</b> software. Building material and area of window information was added by the software, too.

<p style='margin-left:1em;'>

* Firstly, straight 3d sightline was used to delineate the shortest path between a siren and a receiver location.

* The 3d intersection points of the sightlines and buildings were used to calculate the diffraction effect. Though the diffraction path is not geometrically represented.

<p style='margin-left:1em;'>

* The table below includes the equations and sound effects each equation is calculating. 
* They are used to calculate the decible delivered to the receiver point from each siren. 
* The equations are from the ISO 9613 (with Jouleâ€™s Report edition), and NMPB 2008 models.

<p style='margin-left:1em;'>

* The plot below shows the sound propagation model result compared to the actual sound measurement at each receiver location. There were 29 receiver sample points. 
* The model result represented in the blue line corresponds with the oragne line, measurement result very well. 
* The mean of the decibel difference was 0.64 and most of the observations were within the 95% confidence interval.

<b>Extracting Indoor Details from LIDAR pointcloud</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
* This project is going on within my lab, so it's not my personal project.
* The indoor LIDAR pointcloud is to be segmented, and interpreted to read indoor context. 
* Different types of Deep Neural Network models were tested.(Vanilla PointNet, PointNet, PointNet++) 
* 3D objects can be distinguished and labeled as a result.
* The project is halted due to lack of data. Indoor LIDAR pointcloud data is not sufficient and very often, it is not labeled.
